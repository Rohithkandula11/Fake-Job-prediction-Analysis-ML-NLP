# Job Post Authenticity Prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the authenticity of job postings provided by companies by analyzing the choice of words used in the job title and job description. In times of economic downturns and high unemployment rates, fake job postings can pose a significant threat to job seekers. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we strive to differentiate between genuine job listings and fraudulent ones.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to classify job postings as either authentic or fake. Fake job postings can lead to job seekers sharing sensitive information, such as their date of birth, contact details, and education details, with malicious actors. This project addresses the challenge of identifying fake job listings to protect job seekers from potential scams.

## Abstract

In the backdrop of a global pandemic and economic recession, the rise in unemployment rates has exacerbated the problem of fake job postings. These postings can be dangerous as desperate job seekers may unwittingly provide personal information to scammers. In this project, we explore the linguistic patterns that distinguish real job postings from fake ones.

## Methodologies

To achieve our goal, we follow these methodologies:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** We start by cleaning and preparing the data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
2. **NLP Techniques:** We apply various NLP methodologies, including Bag of Words, text processing, and word embeddings, to analyze the language used in job postings.
3. **Model Building:** We create a base model using supervised classification algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression to predict whether a job posting is fake or genuine.
4. **Fine-Tuning:** We refine our model using advanced techniques like feature extraction, data balancing, and ensemble methods.
